> CloneCall will help you cheat at any hackathon by allowing you to run all past commits of the repository of your choice to another repository, within dates you'll define.

> Prepare your project weeks in advance, and when the hackathon actually start, start a CloneCall, and see your repository getting filled with commits, ending just before the deadline!

When we first heard of hackathons and the "no code before it starts" rule, we thought that it sounds hard to ensure, especially when the hackathon is remote.
Thus, we developed **CloneCall**, as a proof-of-concept intended to show people can actually cheat in a way that will barely be detectable.

Team Kenzai doesn't approve of cheating, and exhorts Rails Rumble participants (or any developer) to use CloneCall at malevolent ends.

*CloneCall was not used in the process of submitting CloneCall to RailsRumble 2014.*

CloneCall was developed by Team Kenzai, developers of
[Kenzai.me](http://kenmzai.me).
